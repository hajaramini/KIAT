Purpose of this script is to 
1) visualize how fatty acid biosynthesis and metabolic related genes overlay with the significant SNPs that I identified from QTL and GWAS analysis. 
2) visualize how previous identified loci overlay with the significant SNPs and loci that I identified from GWAS and QTL analysis. 

### import GWAS and QTL analysis CIM result 
```{r}



```

# import
