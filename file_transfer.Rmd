Here I want to record how I transfer data use different protocols 
1) download icommnad to cabernet 
wget https://pods.iplantcollaborative.org/wiki/download/attachments/28117338/irods-icommands-4.1.9-ubuntu-14.installer?version=1&modificationDate=1472924229000&api=v2

install 
sh irods-icommands-4.1.9-ubuntu14.installer

add to PATH by modifying .bash_profile 

2) start icommand inside screen (eg)
bash-3.2$ iinit
One or more fields in your iRODS environment file (irods_environment.json) are
missing; please enter them.
Enter the host name (DNS) of the server to connect to: data.cyverse.org
Enter the port number: 1247
Enter your irods user name: rzlli
Enter your irods zone: iplant
Those values will be added to your environment file (for use by
other i-commands) if the login succeeds.
 
Enter your current iRODS password: mypassword
bash-3.2$

3) use iput to transfer data from local to iplant 
need a script to automate the whole process
